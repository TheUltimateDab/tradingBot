# tradingBot

about the project: The project is built for the profiTech hackathon. Our team is following
 the technology track and is trying to solve question 7 - construct a trading bot

trading bot: the trading bot performs the following functions:
1. periodically filters out tweets and news related to stocks according to user preference
2. keeps check on market price movement at every second across multiple financial instruments
3. determines whether a stock price on a certain day is a good entry or exit point for the
    stock based on analysis on the stock's past history

for now, only the 3rd functionality listed has been completed but we have plans to finish the
 project later on.
